## Enhancement #2: Full Schedule Support ‚úÖ

### What Was Added

Complete backend-to-frontend pipeline for fetching and displaying playlist schedules in the browser card.

**Modified Files:**
- `custom_components/xschedule/__init__.py` - Added 2 new services
- `custom_components/xschedule/services.yaml` - Service definitions
- `custom_components/xschedule/media_player.py` - New method
- `src/xschedule-playlist-browser.js` - Full schedule fetching

### New Services

#### 1. `xschedule.get_playlist_schedules`
Returns schedule information for a playlist.

**Parameters:**
- `entity_id` (required) - Media player entity
- `playlist` (required) - Playlist name

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "schedules": [
    {
      "name": "Evening Show",
      "id": 123,
      "enabled": true,
      "active": false,
      "nextactivetime": "2025-10-16T19:00:00",
      "endtime": "2025-10-16T22:00:00"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 2. `xschedule.get_playlist_steps`
Returns songs/steps in a playlist (for duration calculation).

**Parameters:**
- `entity_id` (required) - Media player entity
- `playlist` (required) - Playlist name

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "name": "Song 1",
      "duration": 180000,
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

### Frontend Integration

The playlist browser card now:

1. **Fetches schedule data** for each playlist on load
2. **Calculates total duration** by summing all step durations
3. **Displays smart date/time** for next scheduled run
4. **Shows status badges** with actual schedule information
5. **Sorts by schedule** with real next active times

### Smart Date Formatting Examples

The card displays schedules in a user-friendly format:
- **Same day:** "Today 11:30 PM"
- **Next day:** "Tomorrow 8:00 AM"
- **2-7 days:** "Friday 9:00 PM"
- **8+ days:** "Oct 31 8:00 PM"

All in 12-hour format with AM/PM.

### Performance

- Fetches schedules asynchronously in parallel
- Shows loading indicator while fetching
- Gracefully handles errors (logs to console, continues with other playlists)
- Caches schedule data until page reload
