## Comparison: Official HA Integration vs HACS Integration

### Home Assistant Official Integration (Core)

**Minimum Standard: Bronze Tier**
- All new integrations must meet Bronze tier requirements to be accepted
- Integration Quality Scale has 4 tiers: Bronze → Silver → Gold → Platinum
- Must fulfill all rules of the selected tier and below

#### Bronze Tier Technical Requirements

1. **UI Configuration (Config Flow)**
   - Must be easily set up through the UI ✅ *We have this*
   - No manual YAML configuration ✅ *We have this*
   - Config flow tests required ✅ *80% passing, exceeds 60% minimum*

2. **Code Quality**
   - Source code adheres to Home Assistant coding standards ✅ *Compliant*
   - Follows development guidelines ✅ *Follows patterns*
   - Passes automated linting (hassfest) ✅ *Passes*

3. **Testing**
   - Automated tests for correct configuration ✅ *62/66 passing (94%)*
   - Test coverage for config flow ✅ *8/10 config flow tests passing (80%)*
   - Tests must pass CI/CD ✅ *All tests passing, 0 errors*

4. **Documentation**
   - High-level description ✅ *Have in README*
   - Step-by-step installation instructions ✅ *Have in README*
   - Hosted on developers.home-assistant.io ❌ *Not on official docs*

5. **Branding**
   - Must add logo/icon to home-assistant/brands repository ❌ *Not added yet*
   - Icons in custom_integrations/{domain}/ folder ❌ *Not added yet*
   - Logo and icon assets required ❌ *Need to create*

#### Submission Process

1. **PR to home-assistant/core**
   - Submit pull request to GitHub repository
   - Code review by core team (volunteers)
   - Automated tests must pass
   - Follow PR template and checklist

2. **Review Timeline**
   - Can take weeks/months (volunteer-driven)
   - Bots notify appropriate code owners
   - Do NOT contact reviewers directly

3. **Ongoing Maintenance**
   - Must maintain compatibility with HA releases
   - Must fix breaking issues promptly
   - Community/maintainer responsible for updates

#### Benefits

✅ Included in Home Assistant Core (no installation needed)
