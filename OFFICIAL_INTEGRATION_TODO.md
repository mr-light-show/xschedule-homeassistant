## Comparison: Official HA Integration vs HACS Integration

### Home Assistant Official Integration (Core)

**Minimum Standard: Bronze Tier**
- All new integrations must meet Bronze tier requirements to be accepted
- Integration Quality Scale has 4 tiers: Bronze → Silver → Gold → Platinum
- Must fulfill all rules of the selected tier and below

#### Bronze Tier Technical Requirements

1. **UI Configuration (Config Flow)**
   - Must be easily set up through the UI ✅ *We have this*
   - No manual YAML configuration ✅ *We have this*
   - Config flow tests required ⚠️ *54% passing, need 80%+*

2. **Code Quality**
   - Source code adheres to Home Assistant coding standards ✅ *Mostly compliant*
   - Follows development guidelines ✅ *Follows patterns*
   - Passes automated linting (hassfest) ✅ *Passes*

3. **Testing**
   - Automated tests for correct configuration ✅ *46/68 passing (68%)*
   - Test coverage for config flow ✅ *7/9 config flow tests passing (78%)*
   - Tests must pass CI/CD ⚠️ *Continue-on-error currently*

4. **Documentation**
   - High-level description ✅ *Have in README*
   - Step-by-step installation instructions ✅ *Have in README*
   - Hosted on developers.home-assistant.io ❌ *Not on official docs*

5. **Branding**
   - Must add logo/icon to home-assistant/brands repository ❌ *Not added yet*
   - Icons in custom_integrations/{domain}/ folder ❌ *Not added yet*
   - Logo and icon assets required ❌ *Need to create*

#### Submission Process

1. **PR to home-assistant/core**
   - Submit pull request to GitHub repository
   - Code review by core team (volunteers)
   - Automated tests must pass
   - Follow PR template and checklist

2. **Review Timeline**
   - Can take weeks/months (volunteer-driven)
   - Bots notify appropriate code owners
   - Do NOT contact reviewers directly

3. **Ongoing Maintenance**
   - Must maintain compatibility with HA releases
   - Must fix breaking issues promptly
   - Community/maintainer responsible for updates

#### Benefits

✅ Included in Home Assistant Core (no installation needed)
✅ Visible to all HA users
✅ Official support and visibility
✅ Automatic updates with HA releases
✅ Higher trust and adoption

#### Drawbacks

❌ Strict requirements and high bar
❌ Lengthy review/approval process
❌ Must maintain ongoing compatibility

- [ ] 50+ installations in first month
- [ ] < 5% bug reports
- [ ] Positive user feedback

### Official Integration Success

## Notes

- **HACS is the recommended first step** - It's much easier to achieve and provides validation before pursuing official status
- **Official integration is a long-term goal** - Requires significant time, stability proof, and code quality
- **Both paths require branding** - home-assistant/brands is needed for both HACS and official integrations
- **Testing is critical** - Bronze tier requires comprehensive test coverage, we're currently at 54%
- **Community feedback is valuable** - HACS allows gathering real-world usage data before official submission
